# Flutter Todo App

Basic todo app build in Flutter by following a Youtube tutorial by [TVAC Studio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCjwl1RrtcSlUrd_-Z-924b3ahWISiDh) to get hands on with Flutter and learn how it works.

## Demo

Flutter is a bit of work to get everything set up so here is a GIF of how the app works at this point. For more details on getting set up, see [Flutter's set up guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To run locally:

```bash

# Assuming you've already got Flutter set up and you're on Mac

$ git clone git@github.com:chet-w/
flutter-todo-list.git

$ cd flutter-todo-list

$ open -a Simulator

$ flutter run

```
